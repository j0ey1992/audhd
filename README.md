## Task Prompts

### Task 1: Setup Modern Development Environment âœ…
"Install and configure the necessary modern UI libraries for Autistic Investor. We need Three.js for 3D effects, GSAP for animations, react-spring for physics-based animations, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Update the configuration files to support our monochromatic color scheme and modern design system."

### Task 2: Create Background3D Component
"Implement a subtle 3D background component using Three.js that adds depth to our website. Create floating geometric shapes with a parallax effect that responds to mouse movement. Use our monochromatic color scheme and ensure smooth performance."

### Task 3: Modernize Header Component
"Update the header with a clean, minimal design featuring a glass morphism effect. Implement smooth hover transitions and a modern mobile menu. The header should have subtle background opacity changes on scroll and use our new monochromatic color scheme."

### Task 4: Redesign Hero Section
"Create a striking hero section with bold typography and 3D elements. Implement a floating Wojak character using Three.js, add particle effects in the background, and create smooth scroll-triggered animations. Focus on creating an immediate visual impact."

### Task 5: Update Features Component
"Redesign the features section with modern card layouts using glass morphism effects. Add hover animations with GSAP, implement scroll-triggered animations using Intersection Observer, and create smooth icon animations. Ensure responsive behavior."

### Task 6: Enhance Pattern Scanner
"Modernize the pattern scanner with clean data visualization. Create minimal chart designs with hover interactions, implement loading animations, and add real-time update effects. Focus on clarity and modern aesthetics."

### Task 7: Upgrade Trading Calculator
"Redesign the trading calculator with a modern form design. Add micro-interactions, implement result animations using GSAP, and create a responsive layout. Include keyboard shortcuts for power users."

### Task 8: Modernize HyperFocus Component
"Update the HyperFocus component with minimalist data presentation. Create clean data cards with hover effects, implement loading states, and add transition animations. Ensure optimal responsive behavior."

### Task 9: Enhance Market Alert System
"Redesign the market alert system with modern notification styling. Add smooth notification animations, implement sound effects, and create a stacking system. Add gesture controls for mobile users."

### Task 10: Update FAQ Section
"Modernize the FAQ section with a clean accordion design. Implement smooth expand/collapse animations using GSAP, add search functionality, and create category filtering. Ensure mobile-friendly interaction."

### Task 11: Revamp Community Reviews
"Update the community reviews with a modern carousel design. Add smooth slide transitions, implement touch controls, and add auto-play functionality. Create a responsive layout that works well on all devices."

### Task 12: Implement Global Animations
"Create a cohesive animation system using GSAP and react-spring. Implement scroll-triggered animations, hover effects, and page transitions. Ensure smooth performance and consistent behavior across all components."

### Task 13: Mobile Optimization
"Optimize the entire application for mobile devices. Ensure smooth animations, implement touch-friendly interactions, and optimize performance. Test and refine responsive behavior across all components."

### Task 14: Performance Optimization
"Implement performance optimizations including lazy loading, code splitting, and image optimization. Monitor and optimize animation performance, especially for mobile devices."

## Implementation Notes
- Each task should be completed sequentially
- Test thoroughly on both desktop and mobile devices
- Maintain consistent design language across all components
- Focus on smooth animations and transitions
- Ensure accessibility standards are met
- Optimize performance at each step

## Getting Started
Begin with Task 1 and proceed sequentially. Each task builds upon the previous ones to create a cohesive, modern user interface.
